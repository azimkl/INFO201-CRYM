This is our report on homeslessness in Seattle. We got our data from [here](https://data.world/sasha/count-us-in-report-homelessness-data/workspace/file?filename=Count+Us+In.xlsx). The data was collected by the Regional Homelessness Authority, a legislation approved by the Seattle City Council that oversees the funding, policy, and services for dealing with the homelessness issue throughout the county. They do a yearly count of the homeless population in King County. The data was generated partly by them, and partly by other organizations like the Puget Sound Regional Council and the Seattle King County Coalition on Homelessness. It's a relational database, and it has 13 different tables, all focusing on different topics about homelessness.
