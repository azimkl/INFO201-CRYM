## General Questions

Why are you interested in this field/domain?

We wanted to explore homelessness in Seattle because this is the community that we live in and affects us directly, and homelessness is a fast rising problem in this city because of the rapid gentrification due to the numerous tech companies moving into Seattle. We believe that this is an extremely crucial issue and should be analyzed more in depth because it will only get worse as class division grows.
